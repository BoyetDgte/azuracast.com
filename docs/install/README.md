## Self-Hosted Installation

AzuraCast is powered by Docker and uses pre-built images that contain every component of the software. Don't worry if you aren't very familiar with Docker; our easy installer tools will handle installing Docker and Docker Compose for you, and updates are very simple.

::: warning
Some hosting providers use OpenVZ or LXC, and sometimes these technologies are incompatible with Docker. If the Docker installation does not work on your host, you should consider using a different server for AzuraCast, or you can use the unsupported [Ansible installation method](./install_ansible.html).
:::

### System Requirements

- A 64-bit x86 (x86_64) CPU (For ARM64 devices, like the Raspberry Pi 3/4, visit our [ARM64/Raspberry Pi guide](./install_rpi.html).)
- 512MB or greater of RAM
- 20GB or greater of hard drive space

For Linux hosts, the `sudo`, `curl` and `git` packages should be installed before installing AzuraCast. Most Linux distributions include these packages already.

### Installing

Connect to the server or computer you want to install AzuraCast on via an SSH terminal. You should be an administrator user with either root access or the ability to use the `sudo` command.

Pick a base directory on your host computer that AzuraCast can use. If you're on Linux, you can follow the steps below to use the recommended directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/azuracast
cd /var/azuracast
```

Use these commands to download our Docker Utility Script, set it as executable and then run the Docker installation process:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/master/docker.sh > docker.sh
chmod a+x docker.sh
./docker.sh install
```

On-screen prompts will show you how the installation is progressing.

Once installation has completed, be sure to follow the [post-installation steps](#post-installation-setup). You can also [set up LetsEncrypt](/developers/docker_sh.html#available-commands) or make other changes to your installation using the [Docker Utility Script](/developers/docker_sh.html#download-the-utility-script) that you've just downloaded.

### Post-Installation Setup

Once installation is complete, you should immediately visit your server's public web address. This may be the IP of the server, a domain name (if you've registered one and pointed it at the server), or `localhost` if you're running AzuraCast on your personal computer.

The initial web setup consists of the following steps:
1. Creating a "Super Administrator" account with system-wide administratration permissions
2. Creating the first radio station that the system will manage
3. Customizing important AzuraCast settings, like the site's base URL and HTTPS settings

Don't worry if you aren't sure of these items yet; you can always make changes to any of the items after setup is complete.

### Updating

Using the included Docker utility script, updating is as simple as running:

```bash
./docker.sh update-self
./docker.sh update
```

By default, the updater will prompt you to update your `docker-compose.yml` file. If you aren't making any changes to this file and want to automate the update process, you can use the command below to automatically answer "yes" to this question:

```bash
./docker.sh update-self && echo "y" | ./docker.sh update
```
